"Through your esteem daily, I would like to draw attention on Indirect collection of money in the name of donation from common citizens by Unions and Associations. On the evening of 26 August 2017, I went to the Market at Naharlagun to buy some NoteBooks. To my surprise, a notebook with MRP 70 /- was being sold at Rs 70 whereas I thought it would be sold at around 60-65/- rupees. When I enquired why it was being charged at MRP rate, the Shopkeeper explained that there are more Unions and Associations than actual population. We have to pay the Unions and Associations. So, thats why we are charging at printed rate. Otherwise, I would have sold this note book at less than Rs 70″. He further claimed that, when somebody is selected from Arunachal at National or International level, then they collect donation from market although the selected one is sponsored by the Govt. This is illegal and indirect way of collecting donation from common citizens by Unions and Associations. I refuse to pay a single penny to these Unions and Associations. I studied outside the state and at every shop, they charged less than printed rate. Some items like Pickles with MRP 110/- is sold out at around 70-80/- And Note book with MRP 110 was sold to us at 75-90/-. Not only this, but almost all the Items in the Market were charged lesser amount from the printed MRP. But in our state, Cold Drinks are being charged above the MRP. The shopkeepers are openly charging extra above the Printed rate. So i do urge State Govt to look into this matter and take necessary actions. And dear Citizens of Arunachal, open your eyes and say no to such kind of indirect way of collecting donation from us.","The writer highlights the issue of unions and associations in Arunachal Pradesh indirectly collecting money from citizens under the guise of donations. During a visit to the market, they observed goods being sold at their maximum retail price (MRP), with the shopkeeper explaining that extra charges were to appease numerous unions and associations. Additionally, donations were allegedly collected even when individuals were sponsored by the government for national or international events. The writer refuses to pay such fees and notes discrepancies between prices in Arunachal Pradesh and those outside the state. They call upon the state government to address the issue and urge citizens to resist such indirect donation practices.","Through your esteem daily, I would like to draw attention on Indirect collection of money in the"

"NEW DELHI: India''s inexorable march toward the most-populous-nation slot with a 21% share of the world''s annual population increase, is being aided by inadequate availability of contraception. Projecting a disaster scenario on the population front, the Economic Survey for 2003-2004 points to a disquieting linkage between the runaway population growth and the country''s economic health. With a 16% share of the world population, India is slated to attain the ""dubious distinction"" by 2050. And this ticking population bomb, the survey warns, calls for ""appropriate and effective"" steps. The country falls behind some other South Asian countries in terms of socio-demographic parameters like infant mortality rate and life expectancy. The good news is that a number of states across the regions â€” Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa, Punjab and West Bengal â€” have achieved the population control targets. While Assam, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have shown signs of improvement, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh constitute the zone of extreme despair. On the health front, the danger signals blip from the alarming growth of HIV/AIDS. With an estimated 4.58 million people living with the infection, India currently accounts for 10% of the global HIV population. If the Survey projection is any indication, the health of India is a cause for acute concern. ""Morbidity and mortality due to cardio-vascular diseases, mental disorders, cancers and trauma have been rising with increases in the number of senior citizens with higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases,"" it says. Keeping in view the increasing burden of of illness, the Survey stresses the need for innovative health insurance schemes. A yearly premium of Rs 365 makes an individual entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses upto Rs 30,000 towards hospitalisation, and a cover for death due to accidents upto Rs 25,000. Going by the response to an insurance scheme launched by the insurance companies last year, more such schemes seem to be in the offing.","India's Economic Survey for 2003-2004 highlights the country's population growth, projecting a 21% share of the world's annual increase.

"Poor labourers from different parts of India, earning their livelihood in Kashmir Valley, have once again come on the radar of the terrorists, growing restless with increasing economic activity in the region. Selective killing of these ‘soft targets’, ahead of the bifurcation of the State into two Union territories on October 31, has also unnerved the security establishment in the region. While executing these strikes the terrorists zeroed in on their targets carefully and with a sinister design to provoke them to run away from Kashmir valley, bringing economic activity on hold in rural areas of Kashmir valley. Meanwhile, toll in the kulgam terror incident rose to six as one of the critically injured labourer succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. The bodies of five other labourers hailing from Murshidabad were sent home from Srinagar airport after completing necessary medico-legal formalities . So far, no terror outfit has claimed responsibility of the attack. Official sources,however, claimed it could be the handiwork of Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit as their cadre was actively involved in the region. Local police officers claimed, ""since majority of work force, which hails from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, have been visiting Kashmir valley for past several years they never felt unsafe and ventured inside the interior areas to earn their bread and butter"". On the other hand, careful study of soft targets, killed by terrorists since October 14, clearly indicate the terrorists are picking non-locals deliberately to trigger second round of migration. Thousands of daily wage labourers had earlier fled different parts of Kashmir valley after the revocation of J&K's special status under Article 370 in the first week of August 2019.Large number of them ran away without even collecting their wages from their employers to ensure their safety. With gradual improvement in the prevailing security situation as these labourers started returning to kashmir valley, terrorists became restive and searched for soft targets. First, the terrorists targeted apple growers but when hue and cry was raised in Kashmir valley these terrorists started targeting non-locals and truckers ferrying apple boxes. The change in strategy was adopted to ensure they do not invite wrath of the local populace and their image was not dented. In all these incidents, the trucks were also set on fire to spread panic among them. Due to complete communication lock down, the total number of anti militancy operations had gone down since August 5 but in the last three weeks terrorists have been striking at will and even exposing the tall claims of the security forces related to protecting apple growers and others engaged in packaging of apple crop. The cycle of violence, which started with the killing of a Rajasthan based truck driver Sharief Khan on October 14,is bound to put pressure on these labourers to return home safely than falling in the hands of these terrorists as 'sitting ducks' Senior security officers claimed, the terrorists are deliberately choosing their targets to scare away ‘outsiders’ and provoke the troops. On the other hand, kashmir police Wednesday identified the terrorist responsible for killing truck driver Narayan Dutt, from Katra area in Resi district as Aijaz Malik of Hizbul Mujahideen. According to police, Aijaz was active since 2018. This establishes complicity of Hizbul Mujahideen in the terror crime, police said.","Terrorists in Kashmir are selectively targeting non-local laborers to provoke their migration, disrupting economic activity in the region. Recent attacks, including one in Kulgam resulting in six deaths, exhibit a deliberate focus on non-locals. The terrorists, potentially linked to Hizbul Mujahideen, aim to induce a second round of migration, having previously targeted apple growers and truckers. The tactic involves burning trucks to instill fear. Despite a communication lockdown since August 5, anti-militancy operations have decreased, allowing terrorists to strike at will, challenging security force claims. The violence puts pressure on laborers to leave for safety and aims to create an atmosphere of intimidation.","The terrorists have targeted poor labourers from different parts of India, earning their livelihood in Kashmir Valley"
"North Korea said it was shutting a liaison office it shares with South Korea from Tuesday and severing communication over a leaders’ hot line, putting pressure on Seoul to break with Washington’s effort to isolate the country. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said the state was taking the move because South Korean authorities had “connived” to carry out “hostile acts” against the country. The statement appeared to be referring to leaflets critical of leader Kim Jong Un being floated by balloons across the border by anti-Pyongyang activists in South Korea. “This measure is the first step of the determination to completely shut down all contact means with South Korea and get rid of unnecessary things,” KCNA said, adding that North Korean officials Kim Yong Chol and Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong gave the instruction to “completely cut off all the communication and liaison lines” with the South. The move could end up stoking tensions between South Korea and the Trump administration, which have long differed over how to engage with the Kim regime.","North Korea announced the closure of its liaison office with South Korea and the termination of communication via a leaders' hotline, citing Seoul's alleged complicity in hostile actions.

"Biden’s comments followed the Israeli military’s confirmation that its forces are now operating in central Rafah as part of their expanded offensive in southern Gaza US President Joe Biden described a three-phase proposal made by Israel to Hamas militants on Friday, saying it would result in the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza and potentially bring an end to the gruelling, almost 8-month-old Mideast conflict, news agency AP reported. President Biden also said that Hamas is “no longer capable” of carrying out another large-scale attack on Israel. He urged Israelis and Hamas to come to a deal to release the remaining hostages for an extended cease-fire. In remarks from the White House, the Democratic president described the idea as “a road map to an enduring cease-fire and the release of all hostages” Three Phases: Hostage release, troop withdrawal, reconstruction President Biden announced that the initial phase of the proposed deal would last six weeks, featuring a “full and complete cease-fire,” the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all densely populated areas of Gaza, and the release of several hostages, including women, the elderly, and the wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During this phase, American hostages would be freed, and the remains of deceased hostages would be returned to their families. Humanitarian aid would increase significantly, with 600 trucks allowed into Gaza daily. The second phase would involve the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Biden stated that if Hamas fulfills its commitments, the temporary cease-fire could become a permanent cessation of hostilities, according to the Israeli proposal, AP reported. The third phase would initiate significant reconstruction efforts in Gaza, which faces extensive rebuilding due to the war’s destruction. The 4.5-page Israeli proposal was sent to Hamas on Thursday. Invitation to Netanyahu Congressional leaders invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the US Capitol. The invitation, from House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has been planned for some time, though there is considerable concern, especially among Democrats, about Israel’s war strategy. No date for the speech has been set. Challenges and Israeli Military actions Biden acknowledged the challenges in keeping the Israeli proposal on track, noting many “details to negotiate” to transition from the first to the second phase. A significant obstacle in the first phase is reaching an agreement on the ratio of hostages to prisoners to be released, AP reported. Biden’s comments followed the Israeli military’s confirmation that its forces are now operating in central Rafah as part of their expanded offensive in southern Gaza. Biden called it “a truly decisive moment” and said that Hamas has expressed a desire for a cease-fire, presenting an opportunity to demonstrate their sincerity. Despite Biden’s push for an end to the war and a new beginning, Israeli officials remain committed to the military defeat of Hamas. Biden, facing a tough reelection campaign, has encountered criticism from some political left members who want him to pressure Netanyahu’s government to end the war. Netanyahu’s response Netanyahu’s office, in a statement following Biden’s speech, said he authorized Israel’s hostage negotiation team to secure the release of remaining hostages. However, Israel maintains that the war will not end until all its goals are achieved, including the return of all abductees and the elimination of Hamas’ military and governmental capabilities. The prime minister’s office also called for adherence to Israel’s proposed outline. Analysts, Hamas react Matt Duss, executive vice president for the Centre for International Policy in Washington, suggested that Netanyahu’s reaction indicated a potential difference between an acceptable Israeli proposal and what Biden outlined. Hamas responded positively to Biden’s proposal, urging Israel to commit explicitly to a permanent ceasefire, complete troop withdrawal from Gaza, and a prisoner exchange, among other conditions. Israel has faced increasing international criticism for its strategy in Gaza, which has resulted in significant civilian casualties. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, Israeli bombardments and ground offensives have killed over 36,000 Palestinians. Biden also addressed those in Israel who oppose ending the war, noting that some members of Netanyahu’s far-right coalition want to continue fighting and do not prioritize the hostages. He urged Israeli leadership to support the deal. Biden did not mention Palestinian statehood in his remarks, although he has previously emphasized its importance for long-term peace in the region. The US is also working to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis insist on concrete steps toward establishing a Palestinian state. Stalled ceasefire talks, previous proposals Ceasefire talks stalled at the beginning of the month despite efforts by the US and other mediators to secure a deal and prevent an Israeli invasion of Rafah. A major sticking point is Hamas’ demand for guarantees that the war will end and Israeli troops will withdraw from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages, a demand Israel rejects. The new Israeli proposal is “nearly identical to Hamas’s own proposals from a few weeks ago,” according to a Biden administration official.","President Biden announced a three-phase proposal aimed at ending the nearly 8-month-old conflict between Israel and Hamas. The phases involve a cease-fire and hostage release, withdrawal of Israeli troops, and Gaza's reconstruction. While the Israeli military continues operations in Rafah, Biden's plan urges negotiation for a lasting cease-fire.",Biden’s comments followed the Israeli military’s confirmation that its forces are now operating in central

JRP/PS/19/2014) alleging that he died under police custody at PS Jairampur. ‘…There were many loopholes which are unjustifiable. The accused was arrested by 42 Assam Rifles Jairampur on May 14 this year during the evening time with Hanglem Sangwal and Raja Sarkar at Assam Rifles check gate. Ironically, Raja Sarkar who was also apprehended along with the accused by the Assam Rifles is missing from the whole scenario related with the above case. Whereas, his name should have been mentioned in the FIR report lodged by the Assam Rifles. This clearly indicates the false fabrication and conspiracy plotted by people with vested interests of 42 AR,’ the letter submitted to the Home Minister read. As per FIR lodged by Maj. Ankur Sharma of 42 AR, it was mentioned that one 7.65 mm pistol (US made), 5no. Live rounds and 110 gm opium cloth was recovered from the accused whereas; it was done without prior consent and signature by the accused as he has denied possession of any such weapons and opium. The accused was inhumanely tortured by the AR personnel, it said. Moreover, the grave concern is upon the custodial death of the accused. While the accused was under police custody, he was curtailed from 'Right to Life' by depriving him from basic health care facilities. This clearly shows callousness made by the police officers which led to the death of an accused. When the MO, CHC Jairampur on 13 September 2014 referred the accused to Civil Hospital Margherita after diagnosing the critical health condition then why did not the OC/IO take prior action with the Judicial Magistrate to save his life? The accused succumbed to his injuries on September 17. Under such critical health conditions after getting referred from Medical Officer, the judicial magistrate should have acted early to save the accused life by providing police escort. Hence, this clearly reflects inefficiency and bias of the system in Changlang district. This is a gross violation of Human Rights,’ the letter further added seeking compensation for the poor family members of the deceased and stringent action against the erring police officers.

Principals agree that completing 180 teaching days (which is mandatory) is a distant dream. They say that completing 100 teaching days is also turning out to be challenge. ""Ultimately it is the students'' loss. They are the one''s who will have to keep pace with the speed with which the syllabus would be completed later,"" said a government college lecturer recalling that last year also the students spent lot of time on strike to protest against attending 75 per cent of the lectures. Faculty members assert that the situation this year is grave as the protest has already dragged on for a longer time than expected. To make matters worse, the science congress in January next year will also lead to colleges remaining closed for a longer time. Concerned over the situation, which authorities feel is going fast out of their hands, Guru Gobind Singh College for Women (GGSW), Sector 26, principal Harinderjit Kaur says, ""Though the situation is unpredictable, we will still wait for the protest to end before taking the final decision about rescheduling of the test.""","Ongoing student agitation has left classrooms in Chandigarh colleges virtually empty, causing frustration among faculty members. The delay in completing the syllabus for December tests may lead to rescheduling, with DAV College, Sector 10, already considering January for exams. Principals, having met with the Panjab University vice-chancellor to end the protest, believe most demands have been accepted, urging students to return to class. However, completing the mandatory 180 teaching days seems unlikely, posing a challenge to achieve even 100 teaching days. The prolonged protest, now impacting science congress closures, leaves authorities concerned about the situation going out of control.","The students'' protest has been ongoing for a long time, and colleges are virtually empty "
"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has sought a report from the Director of Town and Country Planning and the Madurai District Fire Officer on the inspection carried out prior to the opening of the Super Saravana stores shopping mall in Mattuthavani in Madurai. Justice K. Murali Shankar sought the report from authorities after Human Rights activist and advocate Henri Tiphagne sought a direction to temporarily shut down the shopping mall till the public nuisances associated with its functioning was rectified. Mr. Henri Tiphagne said that the shopping mall was still under construction. But it had started functioning, attracting thousands of people every day. There were traffic snarls every day on the Melur Road, severely affecting the people. He said that the street vendors had illegally set up stalls along the road causing traffic snarls. Autorickshaws and share autos were also parked along the road. The stretch between MGR Bus Stand and Meenakshi Mission Hospital should be declared a no-parking and no-hawking zone, he said. The petitioner said that no prior information was made available to the public on whether the authorities were consulted or approached for the formal orders before the building approval was granted and the final approval for the formal opening was provided. There was not a single flight of emergency stairs visible and no steps had been taken to make the visitors to the mall aware of it, he said. He sought a direction to restrain Super Saravana Stores from continuing its business till the public nuisances associated with the functioning of the mall was removed.

"If there was a large subsidy, such as the R9.03 per litre it was in January 2013 or the R14.5 per litre in September the same year, it would be understandable if the government didn't agree to free up diesel prices, no matter how strong the signal this would send on the continuation of economic reforms. What is inexplicable, however, is why the government is refusing to announce that diesel prices are henceforth deregulated when, in fact, doing this would result in a cut of R1.90 per litre. That's right, thanks to the UPA's policies of raising prices of diesel by 45 paise per month right from January 2013, along with the collapse in crude oil prices, PSU oil firms are now over-charging customers R1.9 per litre of diesel. This makes it the perfect time to deregulate diesel, just the same way this was done for petrol. So, if prices of crude oil were to rise internationally, though right now estimates are that prices will continue to remain soft, the oil PSUs will start raising prices automatically, just as they do for petrol. While one argument for not linking diesel prices to free-market ones is that the government doesn't want to take a chance with prices rising in the future, this is seriously problematic. For one, since the budget doesn't have the funds to pay the subsidy, the burden gets passed on to oil PSUs that, in turn, cut back on their investments to fund this there have been times where they have been so cash-strapped, they have been in danger of not even being able to pay for the crude they import. Two, considerable investments need to be made in setting up retail outlets to meet India s growing needs if diesel prices are not freed up, private sector firms like Reliance and Essar will not set up petrol pumps, which means the cash-strapped PSUs will have to set up the pumps, or Indians will simply have to get used to standing in petrol pump queues for longer. If ever there was a move that sent out a very negative signal on the government's reform credentials, this is it.","The Indian government faces criticism for not deregulating diesel prices despite an overcharge of Rs 1.90 per liter due to previous incremental price hikes and falling global oil prices. Critics argue that now is the opportune moment for deregulation, similar to petrol, which would align prices with market dynamics and ease fiscal pressures on oil PSUs. Delaying deregulation hampers economic reforms, risks future subsidy burdens on PSUs, and discourages private sector investment in fuel retail infrastructure, potentially impacting consumer convenience and economic efficiency in India's energy sector.",The UPA's policies of raising prices of diesel by 45 paise per month right from
"After this workshop we will collect feedback on how to make school education accessible to transgender and gender nonconforming students. Based on their feedback we will lay down guidelines and policies. SANJAY GOEL, director, Delhi govt’s Directorate of Education NEW DELHI: The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) said that within a year it will come up with guidelines to make its 1,100 schools “inclusive” for transgender students. The department plans to “train” principals of all government-run schools on handling issues relating to transgender students. On Tuesday, the DoE organised a workshop for 25 government school principals in collaboration with an NGO. DoE director Sanjay Goel said the project, a first of its kind, hopes to eliminate “stigma” that transgender students face. “We first need to train our principals and teachers to identify transgender students. If they come across anyone, they should know how to deal with them. They should know how to reach out to them and understand their special needs and challenges. And for that they need some training and sensitisation,” he said. The workshop was organised in collaboration with a Delhi based non-governmental organisation SPACE (Society for Peoples’ Awareness, Care and Empowerment). Anjan Joshi, co-founder of SPACE, said they are currently working on an anti-bullying policy with schools. “We are currently working with 30 schools — 25 government and five private — to come up with anti-bullying policies to safeguard the rights of transgender students, as well as to make fellow students aware about the transgender issues. We need to work together to remove this ‘trans-phobia’ from educational institutions,” she said. While there are no accurate numbers of how many students in the country are transgender identified, there are many academic reports that detail the discrimination and abuse that transgender persons face at school. Experts say a majority of trainpersons drop out of school on account of sustained harassment. Since 2014, after the Supreme Court’s judgement which granted the right of selfidentification of gender, many universities have taken steps to include transgender students. In July, for instance, Kerala announced that it will reserve seats in its state university. Last month, Uttarakhand High Court directed the state to provide scholarships and financial assistance to transgender persons. However, no such reservation exists at the primary, secondary or high school level. Goel said that absence of transgender students in higher education is a testimony of the “adversities” they face in schools. “A few years back there was a transgender student in my school, whose parents disowned him despite several counselling sessions imparted by the school. However, I should have reached out to that student and talked to him, but most of us are not aware of how to handle this,” said a principal of a South Delhi school, who spoke to HT under the condition that they remain anonymous. By next year, the government plans to complete the training for all principals and teachers across its 1,100 schools in Delhi. Shashikant Singh, the principal of a senior secondary school in Dwarka Sector-2 suggested that there should be a provision that children need not mention gender at the time of admission. “Students do not know their gender identity when they enrol in schools. They understand themselves gradually,” he said.","The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) is taking proactive steps to make its schools inclusive for transgender and gender nonconforming students. Here are the key initiatives and plans outlined: The DoE organized a workshop for 25 government school principals in collaboration with SPACE (Society for Peoples’ Awareness, Care and Empowerment), an NGO focused on transgender issues. The aim is to train principals and teachers on identifying transgender students, understanding their needs, and addressing their challenges sensitively. Within a year, the DoE plans to develop comprehensive guidelines to ensure inclusivity for transgender students across its 1,100 schools. Feedback will be collected from workshops and used to shape policies that support transgender students in accessing education without stigma.","The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) plans to ""train"" principals"

"Although permissions to resume shooting of films came in June of last year, it was only towards the last few months that activities really picked up. In fact, several new projects were announced and began production during the auspicious festive season in October, one of which, the Vijay Prasad-directed Petromax even managed to wind up shooting in two schedules spread over only 36 days.Planning is key for a tight schedule: Vijaya Prasad Vijaya Prasad, who shot his film completely in Mysuru, says planning was key to stick to a tight schedule. “We realised the risks of shooting outdoors in different locations like a car garage and houses that have a heritage touch, but these places were free from the movements of outsiders, which allowed us to shoot without any fear. All actors were given their portions of the script and their lines in advance, so they knew what was expected of them on set. As Petromax relies heavily on conversations, the crew required was minimal. Also, this film has no action sequences and only two songs,” he explains. Cast members were punctual: Sathish Lead actor Sathish adds, “All the cast members, including Hariprriya, Nagabhushan, Karunya Ram, Arun and Vijayalaksmi Singh, were available on the set when they were required, which helped avoid delays in shooting. Also, unlike Bengaluru, there’s no chance you will get caught in a traffic snarl in Mysuru, so, even when we had to move locations, we did so on time.” Nagabhushan adds, “We are still amid the pandemic, yet, we have managed to show other teams how to successfully complete a movie with minimum risk for everyone involved","The resumption of film shooting activities in June last year marked a gradual return to normalcy for the industry.

Additionally, actors were provided with their scripts and dialogues in advance, ensuring they were well-prepared for their scenes.

"The Supreme Court on Friday rejected Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) plea challenging the Delhi High Court’s December 10 order that directed it to change its television commercial for Pepsodent Germicheck and not to print any advertisement that disparages FMCG major Colgate-Palmolive (India)’s Colgate Strong Teeth (ST). A bench headed by Justice SS Nijjar upheld the HC’s December 10 order that restrained HUL from ?publishing the impugned print advertisement or any other similar advertisement which disparages Colgate ST or any other product? of the FMCG major. While the division bench of the HC asked the company to change some portions of the TV ad, it said that the impugned TV commercial ?cannot be stated to be per se disparaging Colgate ST?. In a bid to harp on the benefits of its relaunched Pepsodent Germicheck Plus Superior Power, HUL launched a television campaign by comparing the germ checking power of both Pepsodent and Colgate toothpaste on August 9 last year. ?’Pepsodent Germicheck Plus Superior Power has 130% the germ attack power of Colgate Strong Teeth at 4 hours after brushing,? claimed HUL’s ad in its communications. HUL, the subsidiary of UK-based multinational Unilever PLC, in its TV advertisement had claimed that the new Pepsodent Germicheck Toothpaste provided higher delivery of Triclosan in the mouth even after four hours of brushing. While HUL enjoys 24% market share, its rival company Colgate has more than 50% in oral care products. Senior counsel KK Venugopal and counsel Sameer Parekh argued that HUL had test reports from two independent laboratories of repute namely, Intertek, UK and Lambda of India to support its claims made in the advertisements. In response to the comparative advertisement, Colgate-Palmolive (India) had dragged HUL to the HC alleging that the ad seriously dented its market share and was detrimental to its reputation. The single judge of the HC had refused to hold that the impugned TV ad or the printed advertisement by HUL was disparaging of or denigrating the product Colgate Strong Teeth at this stage and it was not possible, without further evidence being led in the matter, for it to come to a definite conclusion regarding violation.","The Supreme Court rejected Hindustan Unilever's (HUL) plea challenging a Delhi High Court order that directed it to modify its television commercial for Pepsodent Germicheck and refrain from publishing any advertisement that disparages Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Colgate Strong Teeth (ST).

"If there was one seat that defined the Karnataka Lok Sabha elections this year, it was Mandya. It saw one of the most volatile fights between two actors – Sumalatha Ambareesh (wife of the late matinee idol and three-time Mandya MP, Ambareesh) and Nikhil Kumaraswamy (son of Karnataka Chief Minister, HD Kumaraswamy, and grandson of former prime Minister, HD Devegowda). What began as a neck-to-neck competition, eventually ended with Sumalatha securing a comprehensive victory. With this win, Sumalatha becomes the first-ever independent woman candidate to win a Lok Sabha seat from Karnataka. Sumalatha credits Kannadigas for her win “The people of Mandya have upheld the crown of democracy. They have seen through money and power, and ensured that it was a victory for democracy, which I will always be grateful for. I thank all the people who supported me through the course of this victory. This would especially be all the Congress, BJP and JD (S) party workers, who supported me without differentiating my political affiliation. I also thank all Ambareesh fans, as well as the fans of actors Darshan and Yash, farmers’ associations, social media followers and Dalit organisations.

He told the media after the victory, “We want to uphold Ambareesh’s legacy.” Darshan, who was also a big part of Sumalatha’s campaign, thanked the people of Mandya, saying, “The love that you have shown amma (Sumalatha) will be justified, as we will work towards the betterment of Mandya over the next five years.” Keeping Ambareesh’s legacy aliveSumalatha, when choosing to stand for elections, had said, “I am taking this step to continue my husband’s legacy. Everybody I have met in Mandya told me that the faith they had in him, they will transfer that to me. That way, we can keep his memory alive.” Ambareesh had earned himself the moniker Mandyada Gandu, which represented a sentiment among people from the region. He was elected three times from the region as the MP, and through this period he had built a bond with the people from the region. Even his onscreen characters addressed his sentimental attachment to Mandya and its people.

"NARNAUND (Hisar), Jan 9 — The state unit of the BJP today served an ultimatum on its alliance partner, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), saying it would either contest 35 seats or all 90 assembly seats. It also unilaterally announced its candidate for Narnaund constituency. Addressing a public rally here today, the state BJP President, Mr Om Prakash Grover, again staked his party’s claim to 35 seats in the coming assembly elections in the state. He claimed that the BJP was in a position to contest all 90 seats on its own as the “charisma of Mr Vajpayee still prevails”. He alleged that the INLD leader, Mr Om Prakash Chautala, was unilaterally announcing candidates for various assembly segments without consulting the BJP. He said, “Alliance can only be built on trust and not on mistrust”. Mr Grover announced the name of Mr Ram Kumar Gautam as the BJP candidate from Narnaund. Narnaund was represented by Mr Jaswant Singh in the dissolved assembly who won it on the Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) ticket. He subsequently joined the INLD and was a minister in the Chautala government. Another senior BJP leader, Mr Ram Bilas Sharma, claimed that the two parties had “agreed in principle” to contest seats in the 55:35 ratio. He said a meeting of the leaders of the two parties was held recently, which was attended, among others, by the BJP General Secretary and in charge Haryana, Mr Narinder Modi, and Mr Chautala. He claimed that a consensus emerged at the meeting that the INLD would contest 55 seats, and the BJP 35. He said the alliance would be formalised and finalised in the next few days. Mr Sharma claimed the alliance was “comfortably placed and bound to repeat the Lok Sabha election performance”. He asserted, “It will be far better than the rehearsal (the Lok Sabha elections)”. Both Mr Grover and Mr Sharma harped on the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue. They claimed that the way Mr Vajpayee solved the Cauvery water dispute, he would resolve the SYL canal issue between Punjab and Haryana. Mr Sharma said the SYL canal would be the main issue, as it formed the backbone of the state’s economy. He pointed out that Haryana was not demanding a share from Punjab’s water, but its own share which was flowing into Pakistan. The rally was addressed by the party MPs from Sonepat, Mr Krishen Sangwan, and Faridabad Mr Ram Kumar Bainda, a former Union Transport Minister, Mr Chand Ram, and the state BJP executive member and the party candidate from Narnaund, Mr Ram Kumar Gautam. A large number of people attended the rally despite cold whether. GURGAON: The Haryana Chief Minister Mr Om Prakash Chautala on Sunday said here that there would be a friendly contest between his INLD and its ally,the BJP, in some assembly segments if the differences between the two on seat sharing were not resolved.The views expressed by Mr Chautala add a new dimension to the ongoing war of words between the ruling INLD and the BJP on the issue of sharing of seats. He was talking to mediapersons at the zonal training camp of INLD workers from Gurgaon, Faridabad, Rewari, Mahendergarh and Jhajjar districts. Mr Chautala stuck to his guns, saying that the allotment of seats would not be based on ratios and numbers but on who would win the seats concerned. A seat going to the INLD or the BJP was not important. The question was to defeat the Congress, as was done in the Lok Sabha elections. Mr Chautala, who was apparently guarded in his utterances on the BJP,asserted that the INLD and the BJP would contest the election as allies. Unlike the earlier occasions, he did not say anything against BJP leaders. Referring to Mr Sitaram Singla, Mr Chautala said when he had referred to the BJP leader as an efficient person, it was misconstrued by the BJP. A few days ago, Mr Chautala had said that Mr Singla did not have the capacity to win the Gurgaon seat while praising him as an efficient person. He had also questioned the popularity of the BJP leaders,including Prof Ram Bilas Sharma. This had created bad blood between the two parties. The BJP leaders and Mr Chautala had subsequently met the Prime Minister to apprise him of their views on the issue of sharing of seats and the current political situation in Haryana. In response to a specific question relating to his unilaterally announcing INLD nominees, Mr Chautala said it was only for about five seats.","**Summary of the News Report:** In January, tensions escalated between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its alliance partner, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), over seat-sharing for the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections. BJP’s Haryana unit president, Om Prakash Grover, issued an ultimatum demanding 35 out of 90 seats and unilaterally announced Ram Kumar Gautam as the party’s candidate from Narnaund. He criticized INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala for declaring candidates without consultation and emphasized that alliances must be built on trust. BJP leader Ram Bilas Sharma stated that both parties had earlier agreed on a 55:35 seat-sharing ratio in a meeting attended by Narendra Modi and Chautala, but the agreement hadn't been finalized. The BJP leaders also highlighted the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal as a key issue, asserting that PM Vajpayee could resolve it as he did the Cauvery dispute. Meanwhile, CM Chautala, speaking at an INLD training camp, suggested that unresolved seat-sharing issues could lead to friendly contests between the two allies in some constituencies. He insisted seat allocation should be based on winnability, not fixed numbers, and reiterated his commitment to the BJP-INLD alliance. Though more cautious in tone, Chautala clarified that only about five INLD candidates had been announced without consultation, downplaying tensions. Both parties had recently met the Prime Minister to discuss the alliance and political developments in Haryana.","The state unit of the BJP today served an ultimatum on its alliance partner, the Indian"

"MUMBAI: The new chairman of Tata Sons, Cyrus P Mistry, has backed the burst of economic reforms introduced by the Manmohan Singh government and has affirmed that the group's ""commitment to India is intact."" In a letter to employees dated January 2, his first since taking over, Mistry added that he felt encouraged by the ""recent emphasis on policy clarity and a renewed thrust on economic reforms,"" by the government of India. ""As a group we have over the past three years invested over Rs 50,000 crore across various businesses in the country, in the process creating primary employment for 85,000 persons,"" Mistry said. The group planned to invest a further Rs 45,000 crore in next two years, Mistry said. I believe that India would continue to be an attractive investment destination. I look forward to the group playing its role in investing in the India growth story,"" Mistry said. Last month, Mistry's predecessor, Ratan Tata, wrote to the Prime Minister apologising for the wording used by the London-based Financial Times in characterising remarks by Tata about India's investment climate. The Financial Times story had said that Tata had ""lashed into"" the Prime Minister and had ""rapped India"". In the apology, Tata had said that he had not used these words. The three-page communication by Mistry thanks Tata for his ""enlightened leadership"" that saw the group evolving from being one operating primarily in India to a $100-billion conglomerate with a global footprint. Over the past 20 years, the group's revenues have grown about 20 times with 58% accruing from overseas operations, Mistry said. The letter gave an inkling of his vision for the group, with Mistry hinting that he would be his own man, as he takes over the reins from Tata, widely regarded as a titan of Indian business, one who was at the helm for 21 years. ""Handing over of the responsibility of chairmanship brings with it winds of change,"" Mistry wrote to Tata group employees, but added that the core of the Tata group must and will remain unchanged. He did not elaborate on what the winds of change could be. In the coming years, apart from India, Mistry said the group will have to ""deepen and widen"" its global engagement with an emphasis on emerging markets in Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America, in addition to its existing presence in Europe and America. At the same time, Mistry said that each company's path to globalisation will be different, with different approaches to spreading of risk, acquisition of technology, access to talent and investment in long-term growth markets. He also said the group should be ready to respond swiftly and adapt to changes in market conditions anywhere in the globe. Alluding to the current worldwide debate about the future of free markets in the wake of the global financial crisis, Mistry said the group's sbusinesses must play a leadership role, ""in strengthening the positive loop between markets and the institutions that govern their operation.""","It Is the group planned to invest a further Rs 45,000 crore in next two years, Mistry said.

Gilt funds invest in medium and longterm government bonds and fetch maximum returns in a bond rally when prices of underlying assets rise. High networth individuals (HNIs) who bought gilt funds have been well rewarded. With oil and commodity prices cooling off, the rupee stable relative to other currencies, and the RBI cutting repo rates by 50 basis points in two tranches, gilt funds have done well.

However, wealth managers do not expect there will be a repeat of this in the coming year. “Gilts rallied due to a sharp drop in inflation and a couple of rate cuts,” said K Ramanathan, founder, Spectrum Wealth Solutions. With retail inflation already down from 8.31% in March 2014 to 4.87% in April, it should stabilise. Though Ramanathan expects a 50 basis points rate cut, he expects this to happen later this year. Hence he expects gilt funds to deliver a nominal 9-10% return this year. Equities though are expected to deliver higher returns in the coming year. “Gilt funds tend to outperform equities in the short term at the start of the interest rate cut cycle,” said Vidya Bala of fundsindia.com","Gilt funds, which invest in government bonds, have shown stronger performance than the Sensex over recent periods due to rate cuts and favorable market conditions.

"News that Marvel and Disney are planning on re-releasing Avengers: Endgame in theatres, with a post-credits scene and a Stan Lee tribute, has been met with excited fan reaction, directed mostly towards the purpose of the whole enterprise: to beat Avatar’s all-time box office record. Marvel boss Kevin Feige said that the re-release would happen towards the end of June. He said, “I don’t know if it’s been announced. And I don’t know how much ... Yeah, we’re doing it next weekend. If you stay and watch the movie, after the credits, there’ll be a deleted scene, a little tribute, and a few surprises.” The current version of Endgame ends without a post-credits scene - a first for a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. It ends with audio of a clanging noise, which has been revealed to be the sound of Tony Stark building his first Iron Man suit. Endgame is currently a little over $40 million shy of beating the all-time record set by James Cameron’s Avatar in 2010. Avatar’s worldwide total stands at $2.788 billion. Several fans took to Twitter to share their excitement about the news. “So Avengers Endgame will have a new post credit scene next week?! You’re expecting me to go back to the movie theatre to re-watch a 3 hour movie for a scene after the credits?! Kevin Feige, you’re damn right I’ll be at that movie theatre next week to cry my eyes out again!,” one fan wrote. Here are some more reactions: It had previously been reported that Disney would have to rely on a re-release in order to break Avatar’s record. Endgame’s current worldwide total is $2.744 billion, making it the second highest-grossing film worldwide, and the second highest-grossing film in the US, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. When Avatar itself was re-released with new footage, it added $33 million to its total. The re-release of Cameron’s Titanic made more than $300 million.","Marvel and Disney are planning to re-release *Avengers: Endgame* in theaters at the end of June, featuring a new post-credits scene and a tribute to Stan Lee.

"The bill for subsidised kerosene is now over Rs 20,000 crore per annum, and yet the Centre seems rather tentative about policy overhaul. Reportedly, the latest proposal of the petroleum ministry is to exempt supplies for households withaccess to electricity and cooking gas (LPG). Given the fact that much of the subsidised kerosene is routinely diverted for fuel adulteration, attempting subsidy reform via administrative targeting would be sub-optimal and prone to leakage. Instead, what’s required is to purposefully phase out subsidised kerosene and rapidly diffuse solar lamps and other alternatives. The rationale for subsidised kerosene used to be that the poor need an affordable source of lighting. But now that multiple entities pan-India can and do provide dependable solar lamps for about Rs 499, continuing usage of a sooty, polluting fuel is avoidable. The way ahead for policy is to proactively redeploy the subsidised kerosene subsidy funds to rev up demand for solar lamps, unlock economies of scale and, generally speaking, make the products affordable and reliable. The move would not just improve public finances and end questionable consumption subsidies that anyway are diverted, only to cause faster engine wear and tear, more pollution etc. There is no justification to price subsidised kerosene at one-third the cost. It merely distorts pricing of all petroproducts. There’s also a sound case for phasing out the subsidy for LPG, used almost exclusively by the non-poor, the subsidy bill for which now adds up to over Rs 10,000 crore per annum. The upfront, open-ended subsidy regime is perverse incentive to make do with routine inefficiencies in the monopoly supply chain with opacity, cost padding and all. We, of course, need to streamline LPG supplies, end artificial shortages and do away with the ‘black’ market where a price premium is regularly charged for prompt delivery. But in tandem, we need a conducive environment for parallel marketing of LPG for competitive prices, and better leverage of gas finds in the domestic offshore to boost piped supply. The open-ended subsidy on household fuels merely suggests bankrupt policy, fiscally and otherwise.","The subsidy bill for kerosene and LPG exceeds Rs 30,000 crore annually. Proposed reforms suggest redirecting funds to promote solar lamps and improve LPG distribution, aiming to eliminate inefficiencies and distortions in pricing while enhancing access to cleaner and more reliable energy sources.","The bill for subsidised kerosene is now over Rs 20,000 crore per annum"

"ITANAGAR, May 31: Call it lack of coordination or deliberate ignorance, the departments of power (electrical) and public health engineering & water supply (PHE&WS) in Lohit district are reported to have openly defied the deputy commissioner’s order by providing water and electricity connectivity to a controversial area in Tezu township – the erstwhile Tezu station reserve forest. On 16 October last year, Lohit Deputy Commissioner Karma Leki had issued a notice directing the executive engineers of the Tezu PHE&WS department and the Tezu/Namsai power (electrical) department to ensure that the residents of the area had proper land allotment and NOCs from the district administration prior to providing water supply and electricity connection in those areas. The DC had issued the notice sensing rampant encroachment on government land in the Tezu township extension area. There are claims from various quarters of the district that the departments’ blatant defiance of the administration’s order was a deliberate attempt to validate encroached land in the area. Open encroachment has already stalled the setting up of the proposed AYUSH medical college there. When contacted, Power (Electrical) EE NK Jha said electrification in the area was done prior to the DA’s notice, and that electricity connection had been provided there “purely on the basis of the 2011 socio economic census.” However, the PHE&WS EE, who agreed to comment on condition of not being named, claimed that there is not a single point of water supply connection to the area. “So far, 27 points of water supply connection have been provided to individual households since October 2017, but no single point to that controversial area,” he said. On the other hand, sources in Tezu claim that several points of water supply have been provided to the settlers. They acknowledged, however, that water supply connections might have been provided there surreptitiously, keeping the executive engineer in the dark. The sources went on to claim that during the 2011 socio economic census, the settlers in the area – mostly non-APSTs – misled the enumerators by addressing the township extension area as Shivaji Nagar, whereas the original Shivaji Nagar is in 43 Mile area. The Arunachal Times has learnt that a government primary school – designated as Shivaji Nagar Primary School – was also established in the heart of the reserve forest area in 2014. The DC recently constituted a flying squad, comprising magistrates and police personnel, to deal with land grabbers in the area, but it reportedly did not yield any fruitful result.","The departments of power (electrical) and public health engineering & water supply (PHE&WS) in Lohit district, Arunachal Pradesh, are accused of defying a deputy commissioner's order by providing water and electricity to a controversial area, the former Tezu station reserve forest.

"New Delhi, Apr 9 (PTI) Users of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea mobile services filed maximum billing complaints in October-December of 2016, as per the latest report of Trai. The complaints in the case of Bharti Airtel mostly came from 2G pre-paid subscribers in Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Kolkata, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, where the benchmark violation ranged between 0.11 per cent and 0.12 per cent. According to quality of service norms, the complaint level should not be more than 0.1 per cent per 100 bills issued in one quarter. The maximum violations are found in the case of Vodafone, where 0.15 per cent and 0.13 per cent of bills were disputed by its users in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively. Vodafone is the only company during the reported quarter whose post-paid customers in the Mumbai circle also raised a number of quality issues. Complaints against Idea in the north-east telecom circle pertained to 0.13 per cent of disputed bills. As for other quality parameters, Trai found performance of Aircel below par for call drops in most telecom circles. Trai has set a penalty of up to Rs 2 lakh for poor mobile service, including call drops. The penalty kicks in for more than 2 per cent call drops in a quarter in one telecom circle. According to the report, Aircels 2G network crossed this limit in four circles. The call drop rate on the Aircel network was as high as 27.73 in the north-east circle. Airtel, Sistema Shyam and Reliance Communications (GSM) service also overshot the call drop level in one circle each. During the peak hour, the rate is relaxed up to 3 per cent.

"Just like real doctors and nurses, online health tools with good but controlled communication skills can promote healthier lifestyles, a team of Indian-origin researchers has said. However, if their tone is conversational, these tools may lull users into a false sense of comfort, they added. People who experienced a back-and-forth interaction with an online health risk assessment website were more likely to follow the health behaviours suggested by the tool. “This shows that delivering information on health risks through dialogue can help users get engaged with the tool and may positively affect their health. In general, it speaks to the design of interactive delivery of health information that it is not only engaging, but also inspiring,” said S Shyam Sundar, Distinguished Professor of Communications from Pennsylvania State University. The findings showed that when the online tools used short phrases such as “Mm-hmm” and “Go on” to promote casual and friendly tone, users felt less susceptible to their health risks. “The conversational tone may make the users warm and fuzzy. However, if the goal of the interaction is to promote a sense of comfort among individuals, the same conversational tone strategy could work well with the online tool acting like a virtual coach and providing reassurance,” explained Saraswathi Bellur, assistant professor of communication from University of Connecticut.","Online health tools can encourage healthier behavior when they communicate using a dialogue-based format, according to researchers of Indian origin. A study led by S. Shyam Sundar and Saraswathi Bellur found that interactive conversations—rather than static information—engaged users better and promoted action. However, overly casual tones, such as saying “Mm-hmm” or “Go on,” can reduce users’ perception of health risk, making them feel too comfortable and less likely to take issues seriously.",Indian-origin researchers have found that online health tools with good but controlled communication skills can promote

"According to World Health Organization and the World Bank report around 20 per cent of the world's poorest people have disabilities and nearly 80 per cent of people with a disability live in low-income countries. However, their needs have been largely ignored by development planners. The report warned that the millennium development goals (MDGs) would not be met unless the needs of disabled people were fully addressed. An estimated 10 per cent of Bangladesh's population has a disability. People with disability in Bangladesh still fight discrimination at home, society and workplace with little support from the government. Back home, in India too, the people with disabilities are subject to deprivation in many dimensions of their lives. India has one of the more progressive disability policy frameworks in the developing world. However, there remain huge challenges in operationalizing the policy framework, experts feel. Social attitudes and stigma play an important role in limiting the opportunities of disabled people for full participation in social and economic life, often even within their own families. Increasing the status and social and economic participation of people with disabilities would have positive effects on everyone, not just disabled people. While there is a long way to go, focusing on getting the basics right on disability policy would allow for significant progress in the foreseeable future.","Around 20% of the world's poorest individuals have disabilities, and 80% of people with disabilities live in low-income countries, as reported by the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

"Global land-use changes including forest fragmentation, agricultural expansion and concentrated livestock production are creating 'hot spots' favourable for bats that carry coronaviruses and where conditions are ripe for the diseases to jump from bats to humans, finds a new study. The findings were published by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, the Politecnico di Milano (Polytechnic University of Milan) and the Massey University of New Zealand. Amazon Sale season is here! Splurge and save now! Click here While the exact origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remain unclear, scientists believe that the disease likely emerged when a virus that infects horseshoe bats was able to jump to humans, either directly through wildlife-to-human contact, or indirectly by first infecting an intermediate animal host, such as the pangolin, sometimes known as the scaly anteater. Horseshoe bats are known to carry a variety of coronaviruses, including strains that are genetically similar to ones that cause Covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The new study used remote sensing to analyze land-use patterns throughout the horseshoe bat's range, which extends from Western Europe through Southeast Asia. By identifying areas of forest fragmentation, human settlement and agricultural and livestock production, and comparing these to known horseshoe bat habitats, they identified potential hot spots where habitat is favourable for these bat species, and where these so-called zoonotic viruses could potentially jump from bats to humans. The analysis also identified locations that could become easily become hot spots with changes in land use. ""Land use changes can have an important impact on human health, both because we are modifying the environment, but also because they can increase our exposure to zoonotic disease,"" said study co-author Paolo D'Odorico, a professor of environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley. ""Every formal land-use change should be evaluated not only for the environmental and social impacts on resources such as carbon stocks, microclimate and water availability but also for the potential chain reactions that could impact human health,"" Paolo added. Most of the current hot spots are clustered in China, where a growing demand for meat products has driven the expansion of large-scale, industrial livestock farming. Concentrated livestock production is particularly concerning because the practice brings together large populations of genetically similar, often immune-suppressed animals that are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks, the researchers said. The analysis also found that parts of Japan, the north Philippines and China south of Shanghai are at risk of becoming hot spots with further forest fragmentation, while parts of Indochina and Thailand may transition into hot spots with increases in livestock production. ""The analyses aimed to identify the possible emergence of new hot spots in response to an increase in one of three land-use attributes, highlighting both the areas that could become suitable for spillover and the type of land-use change that could induce hot spot activation,"" said study co-author Maria Cristina Rulli, a professor in hydrology and water and food security at the Politecnico di Milano in Italy. Maria added, ""We hope these results could be useful for identifying region-specific targeted interventions needed to increase resilience to coronavirus spillovers."" Human encroachment into natural habitat can also indirectly increase exposure to zoonotic disease by reducing valuable biodiversity. When forest lands become fragmented and natural habitats are destroyed, species that require very specific habitat to survive, called ""specialists,"" may dwindle or even go extinct. Without competition from specialists, ""generalist"" species, which are less picky about their habitat, can take over. Horseshoe bats are a generalist species and have often been observed in areas characterized by human disturbance. Earlier work by Rulli, D'Odorico and study co-author David Hayman has also linked forest fragmentation and habitat destruction in Africa to outbreaks of the Ebola virus. ""By creating conditions that are disadvantageous to specialist species, generalist species are able to thrive,"" D'Odorico said. ""While we are unable to directly trace the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from wildlife to humans, we do know that the type of land-use change that brings humans into the picture is typically associated with the presence of these bats who are known to carry the virus."" While China has been a leader in tree planting and other greening efforts over the past two decades, many of the trees have been planted in discontinuous land areas or forest fragments. To tilt the ecological balance back in favour of specialist species, creating continuous areas of forest cover and wildlife corridors are more important than increasing total tree cover. ""Human health is intertwined with environmental health and also animal health,"" D'Odorico said. D'Odorico added, ""Our study is one of the first to connect the dots and really drill down into the geographic data on land use to see how humans are coming into contact with species that might be carriers.""","Global land-use changes, including forest fragmentation, agricultural expansion, and concentrated livestock production, are creating ""hot spots"" favorable for bats that carry coronaviruses, where conditions are ripe for diseases to jump from bats to humans, according to a study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, the Politecnico di Milano, and the Massey University of New Zealand.

It is funded by a large chunk of the earnings from Mr. Saikia’s businesses and investments in insurance policies. “We understand each student is different and they could be under pressure to attain the minimum marks but we prepare them in an environment of fun to be able to confidently absorb it without realising it. The condition is more for parents to imbibe human values in their children and ensure they play, study, and be self-sufficient,” he told The Hindu. Only five of the State Board-affiliated school’s 210 students were found to be lagging but they were eventually promoted after extra classes and some grace marks. Super 30 model “Rural children are generally more resilient than their urban counterparts but they lack access to opportunities and confidence to face a highly competitive world beyond their comfort zone. Unfortunately, we are in a rat race, and we want our children to withstand the challenges later in life by setting a goal now – 60% in their case,” Mr. Saikia, the trust’s secretary, said. He insisted that the goal is attainable without much sweat as 10% is based on extracurricular activities and discipline of a child and 10% on good parenting. “Ultimately, the parents are responsible for this 20% added to each subject of 100 marks with the students required to answer questions for 80 marks,” he said. Mr. Saikia and his associates studied the best educational practices around the globe before establishing Jyoti Protap Gyanmarg Bidyalay in 2021. If schools in Japan gave the idea of letting children keep their classes clean, tend to potted plants – each child has one in his or her name in the school – and learn skills such as producing vermicompost, the Super 30 model decided the maximum number of students to be admitted per class. “Although the norm is 40 students per teacher, we have capped the number of students at 30 per class. Our standard would be followed when we gradually upgrade to class 12 from class five now,” Mr. Saikia said. “The school caters to children from various backgrounds living within a radius of 30 kms. I want them to excel academically because I could not as circumstances forced me to earn a living at 11 years,” he said. The Super 30 model is envisaged to extend to students who can return as successful adults to continue running the school charitably for “children of the future after I am gone”, Mr. Saikia said. Wait and earn The school has a fairly comfortable waiting zone for parents who come from afar to drop off their children and wait to take them back home after classes. The zone is equipped with a monitor where they can see how their children are taught and what they do in class. “We have noticed most parents spend four to five hours sitting, chatting, or pacing around. We have decided to equip the waiting zone with a loom, tools for various kinds of work, and a mini food processing unit so they can be productive according to their abilities,” Mr. Saikia said. “But producing cloth, pickles, jellies, or any handicraft item is meaningless without market linkage. We are also lining up buyers so the parents can earn as they wait,” he said.","Nabajyoti Barua and Purabi Dutta, parents from Assam, are making concerted efforts to improve their behaviors and focus on their children's education at Jyoti Protap Gyanmarg Bidyalay. The school, supported by the Jyoti Protap Education Trust, emphasizes holistic development and parental involvement to ensure students achieve at least 60% in their exams. The trust, funded by local businessman Protap Saikia, aims to provide quality education and vocational training to rural children, following models like Japan's clean classroom practices and India's Super 30 for effective learning outcomes.",Self-employed Nabajyoti Barua has been trying to eliminate swear words
"New Delhi, February 28 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee started his Budget 2011-12 speech by saying, “At times the biggest reforms are not the ones that make headlines but the ones concerned with the details of governance, which affect the everyday life of aam aadmi”. The Union Budget presented today was not headline grabbing nor full of breathtaking reforms. It did not disturb too many things, did not have too many negatives, so was comforting in a way. And since there had been so many challenges surrounding the economy and the Budget, more than anything else there was a sense of relief that nothing too painful had come. The Budget’s focus was inclusive growth, fiscal consolidation, fighting inflation with reforms in agriculture, social sector, infrastructure and sending the message that the reforms are still on. The Finance Minister is clearly betting on the 9 per cent growth projected for next year and the resulting tax buoyancy as he announced higher spending outlays without raising too many taxes and also projected a much lower fiscal deficit next year at 4.6 per cent. The total tax revenue in 2011-12 would be up 18.50 per cent at Rs 9.32 lakh crore. The income tax exemption limit for individuals has been raised from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh, giving a relief of Rs 2000 to every taxpayer. Benefits for senior citizens will now be eligible at 60. The service tax net was widened to cover more services that will raise the cost of air travel, health check-ups, hotel accommodation and eating out. Excise duties were not raised at the 10 per cent range but 130 consumer items were brought into the tax net with a nominal one per cent central excise duty. However, in what would make several items expensive, the lower rate of excise duty was raised from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. Branded garments are now costlier but diapers are cheaper. The FM also announced the proposal to implement the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) by April next year. It will replace the existing direct tax structure. Goods and Services Tax (GST) amendment bill will also be introduced in the budget session of Parliament. This was a major reason why the direct taxes and excise duties were not tinkered too much as the rates have to move towards a road map. The big bold move was in the form of phased move towards direct transfer of cash subsidy to BPL families for kerosene, LPG and fertilisers. Since the FM had invoked Lord Indra last year to seek rains, this year he said diversifying risk is a good strategy and invoked Goddess Lakshmi also to shower wealth. Hedging was the theme of the day. The Budget announced several measures to strengthen agriculture. Credit flow to farmers was raised from Rs 3.75 lakh crore to Rs 4.75 lakh crore. Reduction in interest rate to 4 per cent was also announced for farmers, who repay loans on time. Faced with high food inflation, various schemes were announced with an outlay of Rs 2,200 crore to increase production of vegetables, millets, milk, pulses, palm oil and fodder. With its continuing focus on social sector, spending was increased by 17 per cent to Rs 1.60 lakh crore, which accounts for more than 36 per cent of total plan allocation. Allocation for the UPA flagship programme, Bharat Nirman, was hiked by Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 58,000 crore. The allocation on education was increased by 24 per cent to Rs 52,057 crore. In a relief to salaried class, the government has come out with a new scheme in which they will not have to file IT returns once TDS has been done by the employer and they do not have any other income. Taking the reforms process forward, the Budget also announced a disinvestment revenue target from PSUs of Rs 40,000 crore. For India Inc, the surcharge on corporate tax on domestic companies was cut from 7.5% to 5%. However, the Minimum Alternate Tax was hiked to 18.5% from 18%. However, in a dampener, MAT was levied on SEZs. In a boost for low cost housing, the FM announced that the 1 per cent interest rebate will now apply to be available for loans upto Rs 15 lakh where the cost of the house does not exceed Rs 25 lakh. The total plan expenditure has been increased by 18.3 per cent to Rs 4.41 lakh crore and non-plan expenditure by 10.9 per cent to Rs 8.16 lakh crore. For infrastructure, the tax benefit for investment in long term infrastructure bonds will continue for another year.","Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's Budget 2011-12 prioritized inclusive growth and fiscal consolidation. Key highlights include income tax relief, widened service tax net, and plans for Direct Taxes Code and Goods and Services Tax. Measures for agriculture, social sector, and infrastructure aim to boost growth.

"A 21-year-old driver was brutally assaulted and shot twice by a group of six armed assailants in the TT Nagar area late at night after he refused to withdraw his involvement in an old case against them. The victim, Lokesh Ahirwar, a resident of Priyadarshini Nagar who works for a travel agency, was standing near his house around midnight when the assailants surrounded him. They pressured him to settle an old dispute and withdraw the case filed against them, but when Ahirwar refused, the situation escalated violently. According to the police, the assailants, identified as Tilak Kamle, Prince, Purab Vishwas, Smiley alias Tanishq, Priyansh, and Nihal, had a long-standing conflict with Ahirwar, which stemmed from a case registered against both parties a year ago. Despite Ahirwar’s refusal to compromise, the assailants attacked him physically, mercilessly beating him before firing two gunshots at him. Fortunately, neither bullet struck the victim, with one hitting a nearby wall. After the attack, the miscreants fled the scene, issuing threats and leaving the victim seriously injured. Upon receiving the report of the shooting, police quickly cordoned off the area and launched a search operation. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team was called in to collect evidence from the scene, and two empty cartridges were recovered. CCTV footage capturing the incident was also obtained, providing crucial evidence that will aid the investigation. ASI Jasram Singh Yadav confirmed that the accused are known criminals with previous criminal histories. Despite their efforts to evade capture, police have launched a manhunt, conducting raids at various potential hideouts. An FIR has been registered under several sections, including attempt to murder, assault, and illegal firearm use. Local residents of Priyadarshini Nagar expressed their shock and alarm over the brazen attack, calling for stricter police action against repeat offenders. Many residents voiced their concerns about the increasing frequency of such violent incidents and demanded that the authorities take more stringent measures to prevent further attacks.

"NEW DELHI: The gift that consumers were expecting from fuel retailers isn’t coming on the New Year day. State-run oil marketing companies have decided against cutting petrol and diesel prices. Instead, the companies would absorb the benefits of falling crude oil prices to meet their inventory losses. The industry was expecting fuel companies to reduce petrol and diesel prices by at least Rs 2 per litre because of the steep fall in international oil rates. On Wednesday, crude fell below $56 a barrel, and was inching towards a record six-year low. “Late in the evening, we have been asked to go home as there would not be any price cut tonight,” a Mumbai-based executive working for Indian Oil Corp said requesting anonymity. Earlier, companies had directed key executives to wait after office hours pending a decision on the price cut.Companies have some additional revenue gains, but they want to make up for their inventory losses, oil ministry officials said. “Petrol and diesel are deregulated fuels and companies are free to set their prices,” one official said. The government lifted pricing control on petrol four years ago. Diesel was deregulated on October 18 this year.","Indian fuel retailers have decided not to lower petrol and diesel prices on New Year's Day but will absorb the benefits of falling crude oil prices to compensate for their inventory losses.

"Anvesha Borah moved from Assam to Mumbai last year to be a fashion writer. Deadlines and marathon meetings became usual as she expertly managed her work-life balance. For the past few weeks, however, Anvesha has struggled to keep up with her fast-paced routine. “I now lack motivation to complete my tasks. The usual daily chores look overbearing and perpetual,” she says. Borah isn’t alone feeling drained at this time of the year. Considered a time of celebration by most, it is stressful and anxiety-filled for an unfortunate minority. Nearing the end of the calendar year, most people are in a rush to wrap up work and meet personal commitments; trying to get through everything that has been allowed to pile up over the year. The result is year-end fatigue or end-of-the-year burnout leaves people tired, irritable and overwhelmed. According to Maslach, Jackson and Leiter (1996), burnout is characterised by a triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and decreased sense of accomplishment in one’s occupation. Dr Virinchi Sharma, Director at Manasa Hospitals, Hyderabad, explains, “End-of-the-year fatigue can manifest as physical, emotional and psychological exhaustion. It is a feeling of helplessness, accompanied by reduced motivation to work on our daily activities, especially during the last months of a calendar year.” Decoding the phenomenon, he continues, “On the biological front, the shorter days towards the end of year affect the brain negatively by producing less serotonin and dopamine which are essential for motivation. Psychologically, the inability to achieve targets, often unrealistic ones, set by the individual at the beginning of the year can start affecting self-esteem and coping mechanisms of the individual, consequently reducing productivity. On the social front, comparing themselves with others planning vacations reduce motivation levels further. The above-said situations lead to a pileup of cortisol, which adversely affects higher mental abilities like attention, focus and concentration.” As the adage goes if there’s a problem, there will always be a solution. Mansi Poddar, psychotherapist and founder of Heal•Grow•Thrive Foundation, says, “Year-end fatigue is a subjective experience and not a formal diagnosis. For some people, there is exhaustion, burnout and a sense of regret or shame around non-achieved goals and broken dreams over a hard year. According to Canadian physician Gabor Mate, how we perceive and interpret situations and events is more impactful on our mental health than the situation and events themselves. Many working individuals will take December as a month of renewal, and engage in the pleasures of life. It’s a matter of perspective and how one chooses to deal with it.” Any interpretation that makes us feel low, unhappy or anxious will take a toll on the body because the mind and body are one organism. We can’t separate the two. It is crucial to prioritise sleep, diet and physical exercise. Practice physical relaxation and mind-calming exercises to keep stress hormones under check. Divya Suhaney, an internationally certified health and wellness coach, and nutritional therapist, acknowledges that year-end fatigue is an extremely common phenomenon. “Most of our clients have overwhelming weight-loss targets while dreaming of getting the perfect holiday body. They make impulsive decisions based on temporary emotions and trends. The best approach is to pause and reflect. Observe, and listen to your body and trust its intelligence to guide you,” she advises. She warns people against dietary mood swings such as binge eating and emotional nibbling. Making small lifestyle changes such as getting enough sleep, restricting drugs and alcohol, cutting down on caffeine, scheduling self-care activities, yoga and meditation, outing in nature are antidotes to the year-end phenomenon. Nature sets a great example, according to Poddar who explains, “Plants and animals don’t fight the winter; they don’t pretend it’s not happening and carry on living the same lives they lived in summer. They prepare. They adapt. They perform extraordinary acts of metamorphosis and transformation to get them through. Winter is not the death of the life cycle, but its crucible. This can be applied to all of us. If we get in tune with ourselves and gain more self-insight, we can build days that feel more meaningful versus only productive. If we hold the intention to be more self-aware and attuned, chances of us burning out are automatically minimised.” Life isn’t a marathon, and the year-end is not a metaphorical ‘finish line’. Maybe life is a slow, lazy stroll along the beach, eating ice cream. It’s time to find the right metaphor.","Anvesha Borah, a fashion writer from Assam, has been struggling with year-end fatigue or end-of-the-year burnout due to her fast-paced routine.

"Even as more than 250 personnel from Kerala's forest department comb private estates on forest fringes in Palakkad and Malappuram districts, looking for clues on the death of a pregnant elephant on May 27, several opposition leaders Thursday slammed ruling BJP leaders for attempts to create controversy and purportedly try to sully the state‚Äôs image. The elephant died after her mouth was severely damaged in an explosion in Palakkad district. It was first spotted in a river near the buffer zone of Silent Valley National Park on May 23. The forest department's combing team comprises personnel from Silent Valley, Mannarkad, Palakkad and Nilambur divisions under whose jurisdictions forests in the two districts mostly fall, sources said. Read | Pinarayi Vijayan on elephant death: ‚ÄòInvestigation underway, focussing on three suspects‚Äô The team is mainly looking for presence of snares kept by locals for wild animals, and for likely suspects in the case. They are assisted by a team of police under Palakkad Superintendent of Police. There has been no breakthrough yet, and sources said the forest department has decided to extend the combing operation across the state. A separate team of the state Crime Branch are proceeding with a simultaneous probe into use of explosives which had lad to the animal's death. In Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, ‚ÄúAt the national level, there is a concerted campaign against the state. The incident was reported in Palakkad district, but the name of (Muslim-majority) Malappuram was dragged into it deliberately. Even Union ministers are engaged in a baseless campaign. If somebody thinks the incident can be used to do away with the ovation (credit) the state has gained in its Covid-19 management, it is only their delusion.‚Äù He said any attempt to ‚Äúquestion the state‚Äôs self-respect would not be allowed‚Äù. Kerala Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress also condemned the ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù against the state, and remarks linking the animal's death to Malappuram. In a letter to BJP MP and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi, he stated, ‚ÄúYour irresponsible statement has given space for airing hate speeches abusing a district and its people. Withdraw and apologise for your statement portraying this district as a centre of crime.‚Äù Malappuram MP and IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty said, ‚ÄúTheir attitude against one place where such incidents have not taken place in the past.that‚Äôs part of their partisan and communal agenda..

He said ‚Äúany kind of mindless and unreasonable violence against wildlife is totally unacceptable and unjustifiable‚Äù but pointed out that senior BJP leaders such as Maneka Gandhi and ministers like Prakash Javadekar are ‚Äúdeliberately spreading false information.‚Äù In remarks to a TV channel, Maneka had said, ‚ÄúMalappuram is perhaps the most disturbed district in the country. Some incident is reported there every day. People in the panchayat throw poison, and not just elephants, thousands of animals are killed at the same time. Birds and dogs are killed. They have killed so many women. They chop off people‚Äôs arms in communal clashes. The situation there is extremely horrifying. It seems even the Kerala government is scared of them as there is no action. The weakest people in the administration are sent to Malappuram. It is famous that you can kill anybody, the Kerala government will not do anything.‚Äù She said that an elephant is killed every three days in Kerala. Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar also stated that the elephant died in Malappuram district. On the probe, Kerala's Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar said, ‚ÄúWe suspect the culprits got local support‚Ä¶a few are being questioned. The wound in the mouth of the elephant was caused by an explosion. There is an illegal practice to drop cracker-loaded fruit in farmlands to target wild boars that raid crops. But we cannot conclusively say at this stage that the elephant has attempted to eat such a fruit.‚Äù Meanwhile, another elephant was on Thursday found with injuries to its mouth, and marks on its body, in Kalikavu forest range in Malappuram, around 20 km from Ambalappara, where the pregnant elephant was spotted.

"How CAG reports are prepared Atono Tsükrü Kense Kohima | November 10 As enshrined in the Constitution of India, Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is one of the powerful pillars of the democratic system, which acts as the guardian of the public money and controls the financial system of the country both the central and state level. CAG report provides an analytical review of the finances of the government arising from the performance audits and test audit of transactions of various departments of the state government pertaining to general, economic and revenue sectors. CAG reports present an overall picture of the financial performance including mismanagement and fraudulent withdrawals of funds, for the state government to take timely actions. To have a better understanding on how and why a CAG report is prepared, The Morung Express spoke to the incumbent Principal Accountant General Director A Pihoto Chophy and former Accountant General (AG) Kohima, Sword Vashum, who went on to retire as Additional Deputy CAG. How CAG report is prepared Our mandate from CAG is to report, so we carry out all these to basically report, and finally lay it in the house through the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said Chophy adding, “We aid the committee by giving them the factual position of the report we have prepared.” Acknowledging that it might have missed out many things in the process, he said, “We just have our way of doing risk analysis, but we do try to cover everything, if not in one year, the next two-three years, we try to balance it to have the whole coverage.” Vashum said, “We pick and choose as far the report preparation is concerned as we cannot do inspection 100%,” citing “if we have chosen a particular year, and transactions happened during that particular year it would be subject to audit’s scrutiny investigation or examination.” On how the initial preparation of report starts, Vashum explained that a preliminary inspection report is prepared in the field or wherever the offices are located which is then placed before the head of the office seeking replies or explanations on the spot. The report is dropped, if the reply of the concerned office is found satisfactory. However, the report is taken to the audit inspection report, if there are no satisfactory explanations from their end, he said. “Then, it is brought to the head office of the Accountant General office who goes through the entire reports, particularly those based on their explanations, because of their importance or seriousness of lapses.” It was also informed that AG is not competent to finalise the report, as the report is finalised at the level of the CAG, which is then, brought to the notice of the PAC. The challenges “The process of preparing a report is challenging in many ways,” besides the difficult terrain and natural calamities which hinders the team many a time who goes to every district and sub-divisions of the state, said Chophy. In terms of documents, he said that many departments do not maintain the documents properly, which according to him is very challenging adding, “There are instances of missing documents and information which are not kept properly.” Stating that it is not easy to have easy access to all information, Chophy said, “Not getting a complete picture due to lack of information is a real challenge.” To this, he said it has to rely so much on its own efforts to get information. He also informed that, “In most cases, everything appears to be good and done in the documents.” But, not to be fooled by the things in the paper, he stated, “To have the assurance, we do lots of physical verifications to substantiate our reports/cases as pointed out in the report.” While it relies so much on its own efforts to verify what is on paper which, in itself is a humongous task, he also added, “There are challenges where it becomes very difficult for department personnel to admit that ‘this is not done’ but somewhere the fact stands out.” This is the first of a two-part series.","The process of preparing a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, as outlined by Principal Accountant General Director A Pihoto Chophy and former Accountant General Sword Vashum, involves meticulous scrutiny and verification of government finances and transactions. The report aims to highlight financial performance, including instances of mismanagement and fraudulent withdrawals, to facilitate timely actions by the state government. Challenges include accessing accurate information, conducting physical verifications, and overcoming bureaucratic hurdles. Despite these challenges, the CAG remains committed to its mandate of ensuring accountability and transparency in the management of public funds. This article is the first of a two-part series on CAG report preparation.",The Morung Express spoke to the incumbent Principal Accountant General Director A Pihoto Chophy and

"More often than not, it takes a movie to make you pack your bags, and venture out to the unexplored. Last year the success of Imitiaz Ali's Tamasha pinned Corsica, Spain, to the tourism map of Indians while the magnificent Athirappilly waterfalls, showcased in Baahubali, attracted visitors from all over the South after its release. What brought these places to the limelight was that they were integral to the storyline and grew on the viewers, prompting many to pay a visit. Some of these scenic locales weren't necessarily even tourist destinations before they found their place in reel. With the success of recent films such as Ennu Ninte Moideen, Anarkali and Premam, Mollywood too has been spurring tourists on to check out the hitherto unexplored local spots. We bring you some of the locales that are seeing a steady increase in tourism: Aluva Film: Premam Premam broke all box office records and everything about it was celebrated, from its character Malar to the songs, one of which showed the Aluvappuzha in all its beauty. College students in Kerala stayed in a Premam hangover for months, and many of them wanted to see the place where George met Malar and fell in love. Says Mithun Raj, a student of a city college, 'Aspiring scriptwriters have been said to visit Aluva and take strolls by the Aluvappuzha for inspiration. Also, not many knew that the UC College, Aluva, was the location of the film.' Mithun shares that many of his friends have have visited the college, and took pictures of themselves in the shooting locales. 'We clicked selfies at the classrooms, the ring-about where Malar meets George for the first time,' he says. 'It felt like Malar teacher is still there somewhere.' Lakshadweep Film: Anarkali It's no secret that Lakshadweep is breathtakingly beautiful. But on seeing it in its full glory in the Prithviraj movie Anarkali, a lot of Malayalis have set sail to the islands in the south western coast of the country. Sethu Raj, who just finished his law from Ernakulam Law College, says, 'The spectacular visuals in the film rolled like a tourism manual. It showed all its landmarks including the lighthouse, the culture and the language and also deep-sea diving.' While he hasn't visited the islands yet, an opportunity is on the cards soon. 'Two of our classmates announced that they were in love, and going to get married. The girl is from Lakshadweep and the wedding will be held there. We are all going for sure!'","Successful Indian films like ""Tamasha,"" ""Baahubali,"" ""Ennu Ninte Moideen,"" ""Anarkali,"" and ""Premam"" have boosted tourism in specific locations integral to their storylines. Aluva gained popularity after ""Premam,"" attracting visitors keen to explore the settings where the film's love story unfolded. Lakshadweep's breathtaking beauty, showcased in ""Anarkali,"" inspired many to visit the islands, with film-induced travel plans emerging for a law college group attending a classmate's wedding in Lakshadweep. These movies have transformed lesser-known spots into tourist attractions, demonstrating the influence of cinema on travel trends in India.","The success of Imitiaz Ali's Tamasha pinned Corsica,"
"Indian men’s recurve team of Dhiraj Bommadevara, Tarundeep Rai and Pravin Jadhav shocked reigning Olympic champions South Korea in a historic win to land an Archery World Cup gold medal after 14 years, in Shanghai on April 28. This is Indian men’s recurve team’s maiden triumph over the archery powerhouse in a World Cup final, and it will boost their chances of securing a berth in the upcoming Paris Olympics. The trio of Dhiraj, Tarundeep and Pravin showed ice-cool composure to get the better of the mighty Koreans without dropping a set. The 40-year-old Army man Tarundeep was also a part of the gold medal-winning team in Shanghai World Cup Stage 4 in August 2010. Then the recurve team comprising Rahul Banerjee, Tarundeep and Jayanta defeated Japan. In a battle between the top-two seeds of the competition, India won 5-1 (57-57, 57-55, 55-53), taking their gold medal count to five in the season-opening Stage 1 World Cup. The success also rubbed on the mixed team of Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj who trounced Alejandra Valencia and Matias Grande of Mexico 6-0 (35-31, 38-35, 39-37) to win bronze. Overall, India have five gold, one silver and a bronze so far, while former world No. 1 Deepika Kumari is on the hunt for another medal, playing her women’s recurve individual semifinal later in the day. In the men’s team final, India were up against their nemesis South Korea, who featured two members of the Tokyo Olympics gold medal winning team in Kim Woojin and Kim Je Deok. Lee Woo Seok was the third member. But the Indian troika put up a brave front and drilled in three 10s that included two X (closer to the centre) and three 9s to match their rivals (57-all) in the opening set. It put the pressure back on the Koreans who slipped twice into the 8-ring, while the Indian shot four perfect 10s including three Xs from six arrows to take the second set 57-55 and take 3-1 lead. In the next set, the Koreans faltered and managed just 53 as the Indians held their nerves to close out the game with a 55 en route to clinch a first men’s team World Cup gold since 2010. Before this victory, the women’s team had previously beaten the Koreans twice in the 2013 World Cup -- Medellin Stage 3 in July and Wroclaw Stage 4 in August. “The nerves always kick in when Korea is in the final. But now, no one can doubt our ability to defeat them,” declared former Commonwealth Games gold medalist Rahul Banerjee, a member of the Shanghai 2010 triumph. “They have been showing perfect rhythm right from the qualifying round and it’s definitely one of the biggest wins in archery. They will now have to hold on to this momentum till Paris,” he added. So far, India have a solitary Olympic berth which was earned by Dhiraj in the men’s individual section. The final Olympic qualifying event is the Stage 3 World Cup in Antalya, Turkey, from June 18 to 23 following which the team rankings will offer two additional quotas for the first time. The two highest-ranked nations, who did not make the cut from the Qualifiers, will receive team berths for Paris from the World Archery rankings. India (231 points) are now third in the world rankings behind China (241) and No. 1 South Korea (340) and are well-placed to make the Paris Olympics cut. Earlier on Saturday, Indian compound archers had swept the team events winning men’s, women’s and mixed team gold medals. Reigning Asian Games champion Jyothi Surekha Vennam added a fourth gold in women’s compound individual section, while Priyansh settled for a maiden World Cup silver in the men’s individual compound section.","The Indian men's recurve archery team comprising Dhiraj Bommadevara, Tarundeep Rai, and Pravin Jadhav achieved a historic victory by defeating reigning Olympic champions South Korea at the Archery World Cup in Shanghai on April 28. This marked India's first-ever triumph over South Korea in a World Cup final and significantly enhances their prospects of securing a spot in the upcoming Paris Olympics. The Indian team demonstrated exceptional composure, winning 5-1 without dropping a set. The victory adds to India's impressive medal tally in the tournament, with five golds, one silver, and a bronze so far. The success of the men's team also inspired the mixed team of Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj, who secured bronze.

"The real estate sector is yet to show signs of recovery, new figures from the capex-tracking database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) show. Project announcements in the December quarter plunged to their lowest since 2005, marking a fall of 91% from the year-ago period, the data shows. The data is worrying because home launches are an important indicator of economic recovery. In India, the construction sector too is among the biggest job-creating engines. A decline in new investments in this sector doesn’t bode well for jobs creation in the economy. Of the new projects launched in December, Omkar Ventures Pvt. Ltd’s Rs1,500 crore Passcode Andheri Highway Residential Project is the largest, the data shows. The overall investment scenario remains bleak as the number of stalled projects continues to be high and unsold inventory carries on with its upward trajectory. With over a trillion rupees worth of real estate projects stalled, the overall stalling rate stood at 12.54% in the December quarter. This matches the September quarter number as the second-highest stalling rate on record after the June 2017 peak of 12.95%. The Rs39,000 crore Aamby Valley Township Project near Pune in Maharashtra is the biggest among stalled real estate projects for which data is available. Among stalled commercial realty projects, the Kopta (Raigad) SEZ Project worth Rs30,000 crore is the largest. At 17%, the stalling rate is far higher for commercial real estate (including convention centres, IT parks, etc). The rate for housing projects is 10.73%. Ever since demonetisation first sucked the life—and the cash—out of the sector, the real estate and construction sector has been in the doldrums. The introduction of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) and the goods and services tax (GST) last year has only added to the woes of real estate firms. While these regulatory changes may pay off eventually, they have been disruptive in the short-run, raising regulatory costs and uncertainties. For instance, the RERA rules may have raised the cost of funding at a time when companies are struggling with debt. There are also stringent provisions for rule breakers, including imprisonment, which has made real estate investors wary. Uncertainty over pricing of projects post GST has also weighed on the sector. The decline in real estate activity is also corroborated by bank lending data which shows a sharp decline in credit to the sector over the past couple of years, especially in the case of commercial real estate. Property consultant Knight Frank LLP earlier this month said property prices in Mumbai have declined for the first time in a decade. If this trend continues, it will mean that the long due correction in India’s real estate market is underway. While this may help solve the problem of unsold inventory and even create new demand, the process is likely to be painful over the short-run, costing jobs and growth.","The real estate sector in India is facing challenges, with project announcements in the December quarter hitting their lowest levels since 2005.

"PANAJI: The Aam Aadmi Party has strongly condemned the flippant manner in which the minister for tourism, who is also the minister for women and child development, Dilip Parulekar downplayed the gang rape of two Delhi-based girls. The brutal crime has shocked the state and has put a question mark on the safety of women in the tourism-dependent state. The party went on to demand that the government take strict action against the accused. “The audacity of the crime is shocking but even bigger is the audacity of the minister in downplaying the crime,” convenor Rajeshsree Nagarsekar said. Parulekar had described the perpetrators of the gang-rape as ""naive"" and went on to state that ""such stray incidents are bound to take place” in Goa. “AAP Goa not only demands an immediate apology from the minister, but the BJP-led government should sack him from his post as a minister to send a signal that such a laissez-faire attitude towards heinous crimes, and particularly those against women, will not be tolerated,” the party said. The party alleged that such repeated irresponsible statements of politicians encourage perpetrators of such crimes and influence the police to take these crimes lightly.","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) strongly condemns Goa's Tourism and Women & Child Development Minister, Dilip Parulekar's insensitive remarks regarding the gang rape of two Delhi-based girls.

AAP demands his immediate apology and calls for his dismissal from ministerial post by the BJP-led government.

"Former’s hits unbeaten hundred; combines with Steve in 199-run undefeated partnership against South Africa Shaun Marsh marked his return to Test cricket with a fighting century as Australia overcame a poor start on the first day of the first Test against South Africa at SuperSport Park, here on Wednesday. Australia were 297 for four at the close. They were reeling at 98 for four after being sent in to bat but Marsh (122 not out) and Steve Smith (91 not out) added an unbeaten 199 for the fifth wicket with positive stroke play. It was a remarkable comeback for the left-handed Marsh, who a week ago was contemplating a spell of domestic Sheffield Shield cricket. Marsh, 30, was selected for the tour but had to withdraw because of a calf injury. He made a quick recovery, however, and arrived in South Africa on Sunday after Shane Watson was ruled out of the first Test, also because of a calf injury. It was Marsh’s first Test in two years. He made 141 and 81 in his first two Test innings in Sri lanka in 2011 but was dropped after his next nine innings yielded only 79 runs. Marsh started his innings when Australia were 24 for two in the ninth over. David Warner hit two boundaries off Dale Steyn in the first over of the match but made only 12 before he was bowled by Steyn, edging an attempted cut into his stumps. Chris Rogers made four before he was caught at short leg off Morne Morkel. The tall fast bowler’s first delivery of the match, after he replaced Steyn, was a bouncer which struck Rogers on the shoulder. The next ball was another lifter which Rogers fended to the leg side, with JP Duminy diving to his right to take a good catch. New cap Alex Doolan and Marsh added 48 for the third wicket before Doolan was caught at midwicket off Ryan Mclaren for 27. Captain Michael Clarke became Steyn’s second victim when he top-edged a hook to fine leg after scoring 23.

"Did you know that Bai Avabai Petit Girls' School, an elite Bandra institution, was once an orphanage for destitute Parsi children? Or that JB Petit High School for Girls was not a Parsi institution to begin with, but was rescued by a Parsi gentleman when it was in dire straits and on the verge of being merged with the Cathedral and John Connon School? That's what Rashna Poncha, a history teacher at Sophia College, said during a seminar on the contribution of Parsis to education in western India in the 19th and 20th century, at the KR Cama Oriental Institute on Saturday. ""In 1909, a Parsi lady called Hamabai Framji Petit sold all her jewellery for Rs 12 lakh to set up the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Parsi Girls Orphanage/High School,'' said Poncha, adding that it was only in the 1950s that the school turned cosmopolitan. Incidentally, a lady called Homai Engineer, who grew up at the Avabai Petit orphanage 90 years ago, has two great-grand-daughters, Zaayish and Aafreen, who are from a middle-class Bandra family, and now go to the same school. ""While some Parsi institutions started out only for Parsis, they are now open to all communities and have greatly contributed to nation building,'' says Dr Nawaz Mody, former head of Mumbai University's politics department. ""JB Petit High School, though, did not begin as a Parsi institution. It was set up by an Englishwoman -- Mary Prescott. Nineteenth century businessman Premchand Roychand contributed Rs 50,000, on the condition that the school be open to all Indian girls, while the then governor of Mumbai, Sir Bartle Frere, contributed the land for the school, free of cost,'' says Poncha. The school was called the Frere Fletcher School. It was only in 1915, when the school ran out of funds and was going to be amalgamated with Cathedral Girls School, which catered only to Britishers, that Jehangirji Bomanji Petit appealed to the high court against the move and since Roychand wanted the school to remain open to all communities. The court decided against the amalgamation and Petit provided the school with financial aid. After Petit's death, it was named after him. While there remain a number coveted Parsi institutions in the city, the seminar discussed the dwindling number of Parsi children in Parsi schools. For instance, at the RFD Panday Girl's High School, which lies within a Parsi colony at Tardeo, only 35 of the 1,000 students from the school are Parsis. ""Earlier, we had 300 to 400 Parsi children in our school,'' says its former principal, Silloo Commissariat. Ironically, while the school charges around Rs 13,000 a year for students from other communities, it's free for Parsis. The decline may be a result of the dwindling number within the community. ""Every decade, the number of Parsis in India has dropped by 10,000. According to the 2001 census, there are only 69,601 Parsis left in India, of which only 9% are between the ages of six and 14,'' says Armaity Desai, former chairperson of the University Grants Commission. According to Desai, Parsi trusts need to look at innovative ways of reaching out to Parsi children, even if they're not in an institution meant for the community. For instance, Desai feels they could fund Parsi students' education in the institution of their choice, and even funding their fee at coaching classes.","A seminar highlighted the historical evolution of Parsi educational institutions in Mumbai, shedding light on their contributions to nation-building. Bai Avabai Petit Girls' School, initially an orphanage, was established in 1909 by Parsi lady Hamabai Framji Petit. JB Petit High School for Girls, not initially Parsi, was saved from amalgamation in 1915 by Jehangirji Bomanji Petit, ensuring it remained open to all communities. However, the seminar also discussed the declining Parsi student population in Parsi schools due to community demographics. Suggestions were made for Parsi trusts to adopt innovative approaches, such as funding Parsi students in institutions of their choice.",The Bai Avabai Framji Petit Parsi Girls Orphanage/High School
"Companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis and Mindtree have at least three women in 10 employees as of December 31, 2021, their HR heads told ET. Most of them are now chasing a target of 45-50% for female employees in their total headcount in the coming quarters, with several initiatives lined up, like increased campus and lateral hiring, building leadership pipelines and skilling focused on women. Professional services firm Aon's recent survey tracking 20 top IT services companies, shared exclusively with ET, also confirms the trend of companies looking to increase the number of female employees from the existing 30% to 45% in less than 24 months. Already, the number of women in these 20 companies is more than the India Inc average of 26%, said Jang Bahadur Singh, Aon’s IT/ITeS lead - human capital solutions practice. The ball has already started rolling. For instance, Tech Mahindra improved the gender diversity ratio by 5% in the last two quarters, chief people officer Harshvendra Soin told ET. Women now account for 34.2% of its headcount of about 150,000. “The internal target is to achieve 50% woman representation in the total workforce in the coming years,” said Soin. Wipro had 36.3% women among its employee base of 231,000. The company is now aiming to hire 50% women during its campus recruitments. “Over the last 18 months, we have improved ethnic diversity in our senior leadership, by 20 percentage points, and gender diversity in the leadership has nearly doubled,” said Sunita Rebecca Cherian, Wipro’s chief culture officer. At Wipro, the chief executive serves as the executive sponsor of its inclusion & diversity council that not only focuses on gender, but also geographies and ethnicity diversity. “I&D is a key point of agenda for our board reviews,” said Cherian. The largest IT services company in India, TCS, has consistently averaged between 34% and 40% female hires over the last four years. It currently employs more than 201,000 women, or 36.5% of the total workforce. “TCS is committed to being an equal opportunity employer, creating platforms and avenues to bring more women into our workforce,” said Ritu Anand, chief leadership and diversity officer. Reasons for pushing diversity are clear. “We need to think like the people whose lives we are trying to improve. That’s why diversity of representation and ‘Diversity of the Mind’ is so critical to our strategy,” she said. Rival Infosys is close to 40% women in the workforce at the end of the December quarter, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Mphasis currently has a 65:35 men to women ratio in the workforce. “With our flagship initiatives and programmes, to encourage and include more women in the workplace, we are aiming to definitely increase the number many-fold in the coming quarters,” chief HR officer Srikanth Karra said. “While 50% of women are being hired from the campuses, the number is not similar when it comes to hiring at mid-levels. Hence, there is a specific focus towards hiring across levels,” said Rosalee Kombial, VP - people function, Mindtree. Besides the entry level, Mindtree is focusing on hiring more women at managerial positions and is building sponsorship networks for women.","Major IT firms like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis, and Mindtree aim to increase female representation from 30% to 45-50% through initiatives like campus and lateral hiring and leadership development.

"The Sahara Group on Tuesday sought further extension of facilities in Tihar jail to its chief, Subrata Roy, to raise R10,000 crore to secure bail. The extension of time to let him use a hi-tech office space inside Tihar jail complex by four-to-six weeks was sought to work out a deal to raise funds against properties after talks with a US-based firm collapsed earlier this month. However, the bench headed by Justice TS Thakur expressed concern over how the Sahara Group would raise money to secure Roy’s release, but did not set a date to consider the request. “You are struggling to pay R10,000 crore. How will you pay R30,000 crore after coming out?” the bench asked.
